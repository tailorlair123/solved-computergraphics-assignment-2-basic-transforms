Basic transformsThe WebGL application contained in file index.html, wants to perform 7 transformations using

the code written in file move.js.

If you look at the code in move.js, you will see that all transforms are initialized to the identity matrix (which performs no transform). Your goal is to modify such matrices to obtain the desired effect.

If you open index.html in Google Chrome or in some other WebGL supported browser, you will see at top of the page the requested transform, and a wireframe view of the wanted result. If you press space, it will add a filled view of the object obtained using the transform you supplied in the file move.js. If the wireframe and solid object matches, you have done it right! You can press space and move to the next transform.
